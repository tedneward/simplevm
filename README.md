# simplevm
The sample "master copy" code from my Busy Developer's Guide to Building a Virtual Machine talk

## Contents
Besides this README, there is a directory "stackvm" that contains the "master copy" (meaning, the code that I cribbed from during the talk) of the stack-based virtual machine. Within that directory is its own README, for any details (which aren't much), and the contents of the Gradle-based code project.

Eventually I hope to add a "regvm" to go alongside it containing an equally simple example of a register-based virtual machine.

## License and legal
You're kidding, right?

For legal purposes, this code comes with no license whatsoever, and has no guarantees other than the fact that cloning the project will probably occupy disk space. Use at your own risk and with no warrantees or guarantees whatsoever.
